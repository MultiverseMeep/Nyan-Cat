# Nyan-Cat
Not actually a game. Made to troll people with Nyan Cat music.

Nyan cat is a harmless program, made to be just like the internet trolls of decades ago. 
When launcher.bat is launched on the host computer, it moves some of the rest of the files into a special folder in AppData, while putting one file in startup
The program will do nothing, until the host computer has been rebooted 3 times
On the 4th startup, Nyan cat will launch its code; it will play Nyan Cat music very loudly, while spam opening cmd windows.
This happens a total of two times, on startup. 
Afterwards, an uninstaller is given to the user, so they can safely remove Nyan Cat from their PC.
